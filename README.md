### Problem  Statement: 
Create a ghost drawing board app, where you can select among three different colors ( red, green,
blue) to draw with and then you can erase the drawing with an eraser selection. That’s pretty standard
drawing board but what about the ghost part? Well, here is how it plays:

1. Anything which you are drawing should appear on screen after certain seconds. For the case of :
* Red 1 second.
* Blue 3 seconds.
* Green 5 seconds.
* Eraser works on with the 2 seconds delay too.

2. The delay applies to anytime whenever you are done drawing with any of the color. For example If
you picked red and started drawing, there wouldn’t be any drawing on the screen unless you would
end sliding on the screen and lift the finger. After 1 second, it will start drawing on the screen at
same exact pattern as you slide your finger.
